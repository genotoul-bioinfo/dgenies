        designed to compare two genomes. It supports large genome and you can interact with the dot plot to improve the visualisation.</p>
        <p class="description">We use minimap version 2 to align the two genomes. Then, the PAF file is parsed and plotted into
        an interactive plot written with d3.js library.</p>

			<p>Dot plots are widely used to quickly compare sequence sets. They provide a synthetic similarity overview, highlighting repetitions, breaks and inversions. Different tools have been developed to easily generated genomic alignment dot plots, but they are often limited in the input sequence size. D-GENIES is a standalone and WEB application performing large genome alignments using minimap2 software package and generating interactive dot plots. It enables users to sort query sequences along the reference , zoom in the plot and download several image, alignment or sequence files. D-GENIES is an easy to install open source software package (GPL) developed in Python and JavaScript.</p>
