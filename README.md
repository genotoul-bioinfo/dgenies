D-Genies
--------

Dot plots are widely used to quickly compare sequence sets. They provide a synthetic similarity overview, highlighting repetitions, breaks and inversions. Different tools have been developed to easily generated genomic alignment dot plots, but they are often limited in the input sequence size. D-GENIES is a standalone and WEB application performing large genome alignments using [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) or [MashMap v2.0](https://github.com/marbl/MashMap/) software packages and generating interactive dot plots. It enables users to sort query sequences along the reference, zoom in the plot and download several image, alignment or sequence files. D-GENIES is an easy to install open source software package (GPL) developed in Python and JavaScript.

Quick start
-----------

This will run dgenies in standalone mode with Linux and OS X. With Windows, please use Linux through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- First, install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) (once).
- Then, install D-Genies (also once):

```
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n dgenies dgenies
```

- Finally, run D-Genies:

```
conda activate dgenies
dgenies run
```

D-Genies will open a browser window. It, can be stop by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in terminal

How to use?
-----------

You can use the [demo instance hosted at genotoul](http://dgenies.toulouse.inrae.fr).

Or you can deploy your own instance with the help of [the installation documentation](http://dgenies.toulouse.inrae.fr/install).

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation, including code API, is available [here](https://dgenies.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
